# Baking

What can I bake?

Fully designed and programmed by me, Ryan King.

Any similar apps/website are purely coincidental. I am NOT making a mirror of some other website/app.

Languages: Python and SQL for backend

Core:
- User has a pantry with their current stock of ingredients (SQL file)
- Break down receipes into tuples (SQL and Python)
- Create database of recipes (SQL) with variables: Time, Budget, Calories, Gluten, Dairy, Fruit, etc.
- Use search algorithm to find most suitable recipes.

Wishlist:
- Scrape grocery store websites for accurate ingredient pricing using user's location.
- Make this into a suitable app.
